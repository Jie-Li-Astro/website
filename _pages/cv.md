Research experience
======
* **Project:** Using Astrometry and RV to Identify New Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs Amenable to High-Contrast Imaging From the Ground and Space (2025 - Present)
  
  **Advisor:** Dr. Thayne Currie
  
  **Collaborator:** Dr. Yiting Li
  
  * Searched for stars exhibiting significant astrometric accelerations using the Hipparcos–Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations (HGCA).
  * Identified systems with both astrometric acceleration signals and long-term radial-velocity trends.
  * Jointly modeled radial-velocity measurements and precision astrometry from HGCA using the orbit-fitting code orvara, constraining the dynamical masses and orbital parameters of the companions.
  * Evaluated the detectability of these companions with current and future direct imaging facilities, including ground-based extreme adaptive optics systems and space-based high-contrast imaging missions.
    
* **Project:** Understanding Long-Term Large Flux Variations Seen in AGNs (2021 - 2024)
  
  **Advisor:** Dr. Zhongxiang Wang
  
  **Collaborators:** Mr. Litao Zhu, Ms. Sisi Sun, Dr. Dong Zheng et al.
  
  * Identified Fermi-LAT blazars counterparts based on the correlation of gamma and optical light curves.
  * Discovered three AGNs with optical periodic modulation based on ZTF and CRTS light curves, suggesting merging supermassive black hole binaries. One of the AGNs even showed potential periodic modulation in X-rays.
  * Identified a rare candidate AGN TDE based on the light curves from ZTF, ATLAS, and NEOWISE, which exhibited the emergence of coronal lines after an optical flare.
  * Identified four changing-look AGNs. Several of them were previously classified as type 2 AGNs in SDSS spectra but exhibited bluer-when-brighter behavior in recent light curves, which is the characteristic of type 1 AGNs.
  * Proposed a new method to identify changing-look AGNs by searching for type 2 AGNs in SDSS spectra that exhibit bluer-when-brighter behavior in recent light curves (Color-magnitude Pattern). Follow-up observations demonstrated its high efficiency.

* **Project:** Systematic Searching for Dual AGNs (2020 - 2022)
  
  **Advisor:** Dr. Yang Huang
  
  **Collaborator:** Dr. Yangwei Zhang
  
  * Searched for optical dual-core objects accompanied by radio or X-ray radiation as dual AGN candidates.
  * Applied the Lijiang 2.4m telescope to obtain two-dimensional spectra of dual AGN candidates.
  * Identified three new dual AGNs.
 
* **Project:** Development of LHAASO-WFCTA Camera (2020 - 2022)
  
  **Advisor:** Dr. Maomao Ge

  **Collaborators:** Ms. Zhengya Gu, Mr. Yunao Xiao, Mr. Siyuan Want et al.
  
  * Tested SiPM linearity and assembled the LHAASO-WFCTA camera.
  * Proposed the potential impact of skylight background on SiPM linearity.
  * Constructed the SiPM linearity function under varying skylight background conditions.
