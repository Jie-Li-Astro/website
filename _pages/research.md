Using Astrometry and RV to Identify New Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs Amenable to High-Contrast Imaging From the Ground and Space
======
Jointly analyzing radial-velocity data drawn from multiple instruments and precision astrometry helps to better constrain dynamical masses and orbits of Jovian planets and brown dwarfs. By cross-matching the Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations (HGCA) with RV data, we have identified a sample of accelerating stars with RV trends with a wide range of estimated ages. Using the orbit fitting code orvara to jointly model these RV data and precision astrometry from the HGCA, we confirm thirteen systems with newly-discovered massive exoplanets and brown dwarf companions. We assess the detectability of these companions with current ground-based extreme AO platforms, JWST, and Roman to confirm and characterize the nature of the companions.
