Using Astrometry and RV to Identify New Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs Amenable to High-Contrast Imaging From the Ground and Space
======
Jointly analyzing radial-velocity data drawn from multiple instruments and precision astrometry helps to better constrain dynamical masses and orbits of Jovian planets and brown dwarfs. By cross-matching the Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations (HGCA) with RV data, we have identified a sample of accelerating stars with RV trends with a wide range of estimated ages. Using the orbit fitting code orvara to jointly model these RV data and precision astrometry from the HGCA, we confirm thirteen systems with newly-discovered massive exoplanets and brown dwarf companions. We assess the detectability of these companions with current ground-based extreme AO platforms, JWST, and Roman to confirm and characterize the nature of the companions.


Three cases of optical periodic modulation in Active Galactic Nuclei
======
We report on the case of optical periodic modulation discovered in two Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and one candidate AGN. Analysing the archival optical data obtained from large transient surveys, namely the Catalina Real-Transient Survey (CRTS) and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we find periodicities of 2169.7, 2103.1, and 1462.6 d in sources J0122 + 1032, J1007 + 1248 (or PG 1004 + 1248), and J2131 - 1127, respectively. The optical spectra of the first two indicate that the first is likely a blazar and the second a type 1 Seyfert galaxy, and while no spectroscopic information is available for the third one, its overall properties suggest that it is likely an AGN. In addition, mid-infrared (MIR) light-curve data of the three sources, taken by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), are also analysed. The light curves show significant variations, but not appearing related to the optical periodicities. Based on the widely discussed supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) scenario, we discuss the origin of the optical modulation. Two possible interesting features, an additional 162-d short optical periodicity in J2131 - 1127 and the consistency of the X-ray flux variations of J1007 + 1248 with its optical periodicity, are also discussed within the SMBHB scenario.

AT2021acak: a Candidate Tidal Disruption Event Found in the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey
======
We report a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) found in the Zwicky Transient Facility survey data. This candidate, with its transient name AT2021acak, showed brightness increases of ~1 mag around MJD 59500 and subsequent power-law-like brightness declines. We have conducted multiple optical spectroscopic observations with the 2.4 m Lijiang telescope and one observation at X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) bands with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift). The optical spectra of the source show broad H and He emission lines and Fe emission features. Possible 0.3-2 keV X-ray and bright UV emission of the source was detected. We analyze the declines of the optical light curves, the emission features of the optical spectra, and the constructed broad-band UV and optical spectra. The properties derived from the analyses are consistent with those of reported (candidate) TDEs, and in particular very similar to those of ASASSN-18jd. The identification is complicated by the host being likely an AGN, and thus further observations of the event and quiescent host are required in order to have a clear understanding of the nature of this transient event.

Four Changing-Look Active Galactic Nuclei Found From Optical Variations
======
We report the findings of four changing look (CL) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We selected these sources due to their potential as interesting targets when considering their relatively large optical flux variations and related mid-infrared flux variations. To identify their CL feature, we use archival spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) taken at least 8 yr ago as well as spectra taken recently from the Transient Name Server (TNS) and with the 2.4-m LiJiang telescope (LJT). We study the sources' spectral changes by fitting and determining the Hα and Hβ components and verify their CL behaviour. When comparing the TNS and/or LJT spectra to the SDSS ones, all four sources showed the appearance of a broad or a stronger broad Hα component and a relatively weak broad Hβ component. As two of the four sources are established to have a brighter-and-bluer feature in the photometric data, during the time periods in which the TNS and LJT spectra were taken, this feature likely accompanied the turn-on of the broad components. Thus, we suggest that this brighter-and-bluer feature can be used as a criterion for efficiently finding CL sources among previously spectroscopically classified type 2 AGN, such as those from among the sources provided by the SDSS.
