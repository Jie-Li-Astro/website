Jointly analyzing radial-velocity data drawn from multiple instruments and precision astrometry helps to better constrain dynamical masses and orbits of jovian planets and brown dwarfs. By cross-matching the Hipparcos Gaia Catalogue of Accelerations (HGCA) with RV data, we have identified a sample of accelerating stars with RV trends with a wide range of estimated ages. Using the orbit fitting code orvara to jointly model these RV data and precision astrometry from the HGCA, we confirm at least two systems with newly-discovered massive exoplanets and brown dwarf companions. We assess the detectability of these companions with current ground-based extreme AO platforms, JWST, and Roman to confirm and characterize the nature of the companions.
